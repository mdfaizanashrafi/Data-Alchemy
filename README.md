## Overview

NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. This project serves as a comprehensive toolkit that covers:

- Array creation and manipulation
- Random number generation
- Universal functions (ufuncs)
- Linear algebra
- Statistical computations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Custom utility functions

Each feature is implemented in a modular way, making it easy to explore and extend.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Array Operations**: Create, reshape, slice, and manipulate arrays.
- **Random Utilities**: Simulate dice rolls, random walks, and generate random matrices.
- **Universal Functions**: Perform element-wise operations like addition, trigonometric functions, and more.
- **Linear Algebra**: Solve systems of equations, compute eigenvalues, and perform matrix operations.
- **Statistics**: Analyze data with mean, median, variance, and simulate distributions.
- **Broadcasting**: Learn how broadcasting works with practical examples.
- **Custom Utilities**: Includes helper functions for normalization, scaling, and visualization.
